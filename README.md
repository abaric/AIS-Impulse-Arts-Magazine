AIS-Impulse-Arts-Magazine
======
This is a web app I built that virtualized my high school's biannual arts magazine, Tumblr-style, using web2py. Users can upload text, video, and image 
media with added comment functionality. I worked on this senior year as my Independent Computer Science Research project, under the 
supervision of my teacher Dr. Grabania.
