AIS-Impulse-Arts-Magazine
=========================

This is a web app powered by web2py that virtualizes an arts magazine published yearly by my high school. It allows for images, video, and text to be uploaded with comment functionality. This was part of an Independent Computer Science Research project under the supervision of Dr. Grabania in my senior year.
